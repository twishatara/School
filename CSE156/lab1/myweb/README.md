## Lab 1  

## Short Description
        The purpose of this project is to develop the client side of a simple HTTP-based download application similar to curl or wget. The user of the application can send requests with GET or HEAD methods to any public HTTP server and retrieve the corresponding document or just response headers as appropriate.
## Usage
        To use the program manually, type "./myweb www.example.com 93.184.216.34:80/index.html”
        The client must accept as argument a hostname for the server hosting the document, e.g. www.example.com. The second argument is the URL path of the document. The URL would have the server’s IP address, an optional port number (80), and the document path itself (e.g. index.html).
