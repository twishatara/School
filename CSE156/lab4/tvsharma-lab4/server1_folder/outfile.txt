outfile.txt1. After the server is started, it waits to receive packets from clients. Once a packet arrives, it
reads the packet and stores the payload of the packets transmitted by the client to reassemble
the file and to save locally on the file system.
The server takes an additional command line argument root folder path for the root directory
under which the transferred files will be saved. The received file is to be saved under the folder
root folder path and concatenating the the path name given by the client to the location of the
root folder. The client path name may contain directory names.
Multiple server can be started to run at the same time on the same or different end hosts. Each
server is started by the following command giving the port number port number for receiving
packets. Also, it takes a percentage value droppc, between 0 and 100, to drop packets, either
data or acknowledgment. Then, droppc could be used for debugging your reliability functionality.
Zero means no drops, and 100 means every packet is dropped. The last argument is as given
above.
./myserver port number droppc root folder path
2. The client reads a file from disk and sends it to each server over a UDP socket. In order to send
the file, the client breaks the file up into mtu-byte sized packets. The client must be concurrent
in sending packets to all of the servers using threads.

The client expects the file to be saved by the servers correctly and reliably. The client commu-
nicates to the servers the path name for saving the output bytes. This path name is specified

by the command argument out file path. The resulting new output file (on the server) must be
identical to the initial read file for correctness and success. In particular, the bytes in the file
must be correct, even if the packets have been re-ordered in transit to a server.
The client must exit successfully, i.e., with exit(0), when the file has been fully and reliably
acknowledged by all of the servers. Remember that both packet loss and re-ordering may occur
in-transit.
If there are packet losses, the client must re-transmit each lost packet at least three times but
no more than ten times before giving up and exiting with failure. If there are any losses, the
client must detect and print an error message â€œPacket loss detectedâ€ to stderr, whenever it
re-transmits a packet. If it has reached the limit of re-transmitting the same packet ten times, it
must print an error message â€œReached max re-transmission limitâ€ to stderr and exit with failure
only if all of the servers are down. Thus, as long at least one server is up, the client should
continue to send reliably to that one server to the finish transfer.
The client sends at most winsz many packets in transit that are yet to be acknowledged. There

are various reliable transfer protocols that work with a window of packets, e.g., â€œGo-Back-
Nâ€ or â€œSelective Repeat.â€ Each time the client sends out a DATA packet, it must print to

stdout the sequence number pktsn of the current DATA packet being sent. it must print the
acknowledgement numbers as they are received. The line must include details of the state of
the window being used to control the data transfer. These must be formatted as described in
the requirements section below.
