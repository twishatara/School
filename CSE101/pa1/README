## Programing Assignment 1: Lexographic Ordering

## Short Description
        In this assignment, the goal was to build a Integer List abstract data tyoe, and use it to indirectley alphabetize the lines in a file. The main() is held in the Lex.c file, and the List.c file will hold the supporting functions for operations.

## Build
        To build the main program manually, type "clang -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wpedantic -o Lex Lex.c‚Äù

## Errors
        No known errors/issues with the program

## Credit
        Please not that I have refrenced Professor Tantalo's example programs for Queue.c and Queue.h, as well as File.io. Additionally, I had high level psuedocode, verbal collaboration with my sister Krisha Sharma (krvsharm).
